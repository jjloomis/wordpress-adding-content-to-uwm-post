# Logging into the Site

To log into a self-hosted WordPress site \(like Media Milwaukee or The UWM Post\), go to the site's home page and add `/wp-admin/` to the end of the URL. 

## Media Milwaukee

1. Go to the following URL: [http://mediamilwaukee.com/wp-admin/](http://mediamilwaukee.com/wp-admin/)
2. Use your UWM email address in the username field. Use the password you created when you [reset your password](/accessing-the-news-site/resetting-your-password.md). **Note:** Your password is not synced with your UWM accounts \(D2L, PAWS, Outlook 365, etc.\) Your username is your UWM email address because it's an easy to remember unique identifier. 

## UWM Post

1. Go to the following URL: [http://uwmpost.com/wp-admin/](http://uwmpost.com/wp-admin/)
2. Use your UWM email address in the username field. Use the password you created when you [reset your password](/accessing-the-news-site/resetting-your-password.md). **Note:** Your password is not synced with your UWM accounts \(D2L, PAWS, Outlook 365, etc.\) Your username is your UWM email address because it's an easy to remember unique identifier.
